Georeferencing old maps from the San Mateo County Department of Planning and Building

## Introduction
The [San Mateo County Department of Planning and Building](http://planning.smcgov.org/) has scaned about 125 old maps from its paper map collection. Rather than letting these digital maps gather dust on hard drives, we're georeferencing these maps and making as many of them available to the public as possible.

## The Work
Georeferencing is the process of assigning spatial coordinates to data that is spatial in nature, but has no explicit geographic coordinate system. Here, we will take scanned map images from the County and add them to a base map in QGIS.

## Steps
1. [Download QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) if you need it
1. Find a map you'd like to georeference on the [OpenSMC Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4abucxuAKOWSlVvaE5JWjFkdE0)
1. Download the image file
1. Download the QGIS project file that contains the base layers you'll use to geocode to
